# ESP32_TelegramBot
A Telegram bot driven by and ESP32

## Requirement Libraries
* ArduinoJson (version 5.13.5)
* UniversalTelegramBot (used latest version 1.1.0 at July 2020)

## Notes
I am mostly playing around with the EchoBot example found in Examples > UniversalTelegramBot > ESP32 > EchoBot after installing the libraries above.

Right now it replies back with what ever you say. I intend to add the ability to send commands and get specific replies back later. Could be used to monitor sensors and reply back with temperature data or something similar.
